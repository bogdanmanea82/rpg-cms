    <h1>Docker Compose Learning Environment</h1>
    <div class="info">
        <p>This page is served by nginx running in a Docker container.</p>
        <p>The container was started using Docker Compose, which orchestrates
           multiple services defined in docker-compose.yml.</p>
        <p>This demonstrates how Docker Compose simplifies managing multi-container
           applications.</p>

<div class="info">
    <h2>Live Updates</h2>
    <p>Because this directory is mounted as a volume, changes to files appear
       immediately without restarting the container.</p>
    <p>This is how you'll develop with Docker - your code lives on your host,
       mounted into containers for execution.</p>
